  <h1>Forest ecosystem products and services</h2>
<p>Forests play a vital role in Canada’s economic health, with the forest industry accounting for some 297,000 direct and indirect jobs.</p>

<p>At the same time, forests also store carbon, preserve soils and nurture a diversity of species. These non-timber benefits are known as “ecosystem services.”</p>
