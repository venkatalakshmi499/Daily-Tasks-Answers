	<p>Trees and forested ecosystems are a critical part of our earth, our economy and our way of life, from reducing carbon pollution and purifying groundwater to providing timber for buildings and pulp for paper products. Forest Management is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) major that prepares graduates to sustainably <strong>manage our natural forest ecosystems and forest plantations.</strong></p>	
	<p>After sophomore year, students spend nine weeks in the forest at “Summer Camp.” During this unforgettable summer, students live, learn and work in the forest studying forest measurements, plant community ecology, silviculture, fire management and wildlife management.</p>

<p>Our Forest Management Program is fully accredited by the <u>Society of American Foresters (SAF)</u> and is a great fit for students looking for an environmental career that takes them outside. Our students graduate prepared for a wide range of professions from consulting forestry to restoration ecology.</p>
